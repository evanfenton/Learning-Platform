# Learning-Platform
ENSF 409 Term Project

Authors: Gibson Dziwinski, Evan Fenton, and Evan Mcphee

This is a client-server application with a GUI, light database functionality, and some other things like Email and file storage/viewing.

The idea was to make an application similar to D2L or other learning applications where students could manage their classes,
see their grades, get new assignments, and send an Email message to the Professor for a course. Professors can enroll/take out
students from courses (not super accurate but that was required), add new assignments, send mass-Emails to the students of a 
course, and enter/adjust students grades.
